App development repo for grocery assistant

Create an app and website to help users have the most cost-optimal shopping experience:

#1 User creates regular/custom shopping list:
> App outputs cheapest prices for the products and the location

> Potentially calculate distance to different stores (using total price of groceries)

> Gives the user the cheapest/most convenient option

#2 User chooses dish:
> App gives recipe, which user can edit (vegan/vegetarian/custom)

> App adds items in shopping list

> App uses #1 to give optimal solution

#3 Potential delivery:
> Personal deliver or connect with existing delivery (60-60 if permission given) to do deliveries.
